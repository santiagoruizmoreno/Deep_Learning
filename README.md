# Deep_Learning_Homework

Authors: Santiago RUIZ and Khadija HAFSIA

The objectif of this github repository is to provide insights regarding deep neural networks and facial landmarks.

In this repository, you will find a literature review (short, for the complexity of the papers dealt is non negligible), an attempt to create a code for facial lanmark detection, and a training dataset.
